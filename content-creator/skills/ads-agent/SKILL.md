## Conversion Psychology

### Cialdini's 7 Principles

| Principle | Ad Application | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **Reciprocity** | Free value first | "Download FREE guide" |
| **Scarcity** | Limited offers | "Only 24 hours left" |
| **Authority** | Credentials | "Featured in Forbes" |
| **Consistency** | Micro-commitments | "Take 2-min quiz" |
| **Liking** | UGC, relatable | "Hey! I was like you" |
| **Social Proof** | Numbers | "Join 50,000+ who..." |
| **Unity** | Tribe identity | "Built by marketers, for marketers" |

### Cognitive Biases

| Bias | Application |
|------|-------------|
| **Anchoring** | Show high price first, then discount |
| **Loss Aversion** | Frame as what they'll lose |
| **Bandwagon** | Show popularity/trending |
| **Framing** | "95% success" vs "5% fail" |

---

## Creative Testing Framework

### Testing Hierarchy (Impact Order)

1. **CONCEPT** (Highest) - What angle? Testimonial vs Demo vs Educational
2. **FORMAT** (High) - Video vs Image vs Carousel
3. **HOOK** (High) - First 3 seconds/line
4. **COPY** (Medium) - Body text, tone
5. **CTA** (Medium-Low) - Button text

### Testing Rules
- ONE variable per test
- Minimum 1,000 impressions per variation
- Wait for 95% statistical significance
- Document hypothesis BEFORE test
- Winner becomes new control
