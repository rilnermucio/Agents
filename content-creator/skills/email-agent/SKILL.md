## Subject Line Mastery

### Psychology Triggers

| Trigger | Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Curiosity** | Mystery + incomplete info | "This changed everything for me..." |
| **Urgency** | Time limitation | "24 hours left: Your spot expires" |
| **Benefit** | Clear outcome | "Double your leads in 30 days" |
| **Numbers** | Specific data | "7 mistakes killing your conversions" |
| **Personalization** | Name + context | "{First_name}, quick question" |
| **Story** | Narrative hook | "The day I almost gave up..." |
| **Social Proof** | Others' success | "How Sarah made $50K in her first launch" |
| **Questions** | Engagement | "Are you making this mistake?" |
| **Contrarian** | Challenge beliefs | "Stop writing daily emails (here's why)" |
| **Announcement** | News value | "Introducing: The new way to..." |

### Subject Line Formulas

```
CURIOSITY
• "This changed everything for me"
• "I shouldn't be telling you this..."
• "What nobody tells you about [topic]"
• "The real reason you're not [achieving X]"
• "{First_name}, can I tell you a secret?"

URGENCY
• "Last chance: [Offer] ends tonight"
• "Only [X] spots left"
• "[Time] left to claim [benefit]"
• "Going, going..."
• "If you're still thinking about it..."

BENEFIT
• "How to [achieve result] in [time]"
• "The shortcut to [desired outcome]"
• "Double your [metric] without [pain]"
• "Stop [pain], start [pleasure]"
• "What if you could [benefit]?"

NUMBERS
• "[Number] ways to [achieve result]"
• "The [X]-step process for [outcome]"
• "[Number] mistakes killing your [goal]"
• "From $[X] to $[Y] in [time]"
• "The $[X] mistake you're making"
```

### Subject Line Best Practices

| Element | Best Practice | Example |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Length** | 30-50 characters (mobile-friendly) | "Your cart is waiting..." |
| **Personalization** | Use name or behavioral data | "[Name], you left this behind" |
| **Emojis** | 1 max, relevant only | "🔥 Flash sale: 50% off today" |
| **Numbers** | Specific > vague | "7 tips" vs. "tips" |
| **Power words** | Create emotion | Free, new, secret, exclusive |
| **Lowercase** | Can feel personal | "hey, got a minute?" |
| **Questions** | Spark curiosity | "Did you see this?" |

## Preview Text Strategy

### Preview Text Formula

```
Subject Line + Preview Text = Complete Hook

Subject: "You're leaving money on the table"
Preview: "Here's the simple fix (takes 5 minutes)"

Subject: "Quick question about your goals"
Preview: "I noticed something and wanted to reach out personally"

Subject: "Your cart is waiting"
Preview: "Complete your order and get free shipping today"
```

### Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Complement the subject | Repeat the subject |
| Add curiosity or benefit | Be vague |
| Include specific value | Leave empty (shows "View in browser") |
| Keep under 90 characters | Write an essay |
| Test different approaches | Ignore preview text |

## Email Copywriting Frameworks

### PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

```
PROBLEM
Open with the pain point the reader faces.
Make them feel understood and seen.

AGITATE
Expand on the consequences of not solving it.
Build emotional urgency. What happens if they don't act?

SOLUTION
Present your content/offer as the answer.
Show the transformation that's possible.

CTA
Clear, single call to action.
Make it obvious what to do next.
```

### AIDA (Attention-Interest-Desire-Action)

```
ATTENTION
Strong opening line that hooks immediately.
Pattern interrupt or bold statement.

INTEREST
Expand on the hook with relevant details.
Show you understand their situation.

DESIRE
Paint the picture of the outcome.
Benefits, proof, transformation.

ACTION
Clear CTA with urgency or reason to act now.
Single focus, make it easy.
```

### BAB (Before-After-Bridge)

```
BEFORE
Describe current painful situation.
"You're probably struggling with..."

AFTER
Paint the picture of life after solution.
"Imagine waking up to..."

BRIDGE
Show how to get from before to after.
"Here's how to make that happen..."
```

### PASTOR Framework

```
P - Problem: Identify the pain
A - Amplify: Make the problem feel urgent
S - Story: Share a relatable narrative
T - Transformation: Show what's possible
O - Offer: Present your solution
R - Response: Clear call to action
```

### Opening Line Examples

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| **Question** | "What would you do with an extra 10 hours per week?" |
| **Bold statement** | "Everything you've been told about [topic] is wrong." |
| **Personal** | "I've been thinking about you and wanted to share..." |
| **Story** | "Last Tuesday, something unexpected happened..." |
| **Data** | "73% of [audience] struggle with [problem]. Are you one?" |
| **Direct** | "I'm going to show you exactly how to [achieve result]." |
| **Empathy** | "I know how frustrating it is when [pain point]..." |

## CTA Best Practices

### CTA Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Single focus** | One CTA per email (or one primary) |
| **Action verb** | "Get", "Download", "Start", "Join" |
| **Benefit-driven** | "Get your free guide" vs. "Click here" |
| **Visible** | Button + text link (different preferences) |
| **Urgent** | "Get it now" vs. "Get it" |
| **Repeated** | Place CTA 2-3 times in longer emails |

### CTA Button Copy Examples

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| Submit | Get My Free Guide |
| Click Here | Start My Free Trial |
| Learn More | Show Me How |
| Buy Now | Get Instant Access |
| Download | Send Me the Checklist |
| Register | Save My Spot |

## Email Automation Flows

### Essential Flows

| Flow | Trigger | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Welcome Series | New subscriber | Onboard, introduce, first conversion |
| Abandoned Cart | Cart abandoned | Recover sale |
| Browse Abandonment | Viewed but didn't add | Re-engage interest |
| Post-Purchase | After purchase | Confirm, educate, upsell |
| Win-Back | Inactive 60-90 days | Re-engage dormant |
| Birthday/Anniversary | Date-based | Relationship building |
| Re-engagement | No open in 60 days | Clean list or win back |
| Replenishment | Time since last purchase | Remind to reorder |

### Flow Design Principles

```
ENTRY TRIGGER
└── Clear, specific action or condition

TIMING
└── Based on user behavior, not arbitrary

CONTENT
└── Relevant to the trigger and stage

EXIT CONDITIONS
└── When to stop (purchased, unsubscribed, engaged)

BRANCHING
└── Different paths based on behavior
```

### Branching Logic Examples

| Decision Point | Condition | Path A | Path B |
|----------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| After Email 1 | Opened? | Skip to higher-intent | Send reminder |
| After 3 emails | Clicked? | Sales path | More nurture |
| Any point | Purchased? | Exit → Post-purchase | Continue flow |
| Mid-sequence | VIP customer? | Premium treatment | Standard path |

## Deliverability Optimization

### Authentication Checklist

| Protocol | Purpose | Status Check |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| **SPF** | Authorize sending IPs | DNS record published |
| **DKIM** | Sign emails cryptographically | Key configured |
| **DMARC** | Policy enforcement | Policy set (none→quarantine→reject) |
| **Custom tracking domain** | Brand links | Configured in ESP |
